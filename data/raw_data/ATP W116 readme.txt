NOTES

For a small number of respondents with high risk of identification, certain values have been randomly swapped with those of lower risk cases with similar characteristics.

The following variables containing geographical information about respondents have been removed from this dataset due to the high risk of identification.

XCONGREPCAND
XCONGDEMCAND
If you are interested in replicating an analysis using these variables, please contact us.  

HORSE_W116
This created variable combines responses from CONG_W116 and CONGA_W116 to analyze leaned congressional vote preference ahead of the 2022 election. Registered voters living in districts with only Democratic candidates were coded as voting for a Democrat. The syntax to create HORSE_W116 uses a variable containing respondents' congressional district. This variable is not included in the dataset due to the high risk of identification, and as such the syntax is not included in the readme. If you would like to replicate this variable, please contact us.  

VTPPL2_SUM_W116 
This created variable combines responses from VTPPL2_W116 and VTPPL2DC_W116. The two original variables have been removed from the dataset due to the high risk of identification. 

ERNLAB_CPS_W112
This variable about labor union membership was asked on ATP W112 (Fielded from July 18 to Aug. 21, 2022) and is included in the W116 dataset. 

VOTED/VOTEGEN
This dataset contains two variables related to turnout in the 2020 presidential election. F_VOTED is the turnout measurement, and  F_VOTEGEN is the vote choice measurement. Wave 116 respondents who completed Wave 78 (fielded November 12-17, 2020) or Wave 91 (fielded June 14-27, 2021) were not asked VOTED_W116 or VOTEGEN_POST_W116. These were only administered to respondents who did not participate in Wave 78 or 91.
